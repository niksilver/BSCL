Notes:
- Used the language of the problem. E.g. "place" method instead of "enqueue".
- Instruction message implementation very simple, just for testing
  the InstructionQueue class. In the one-hour version it omits all but the
  essential parameter of instructionType (required for prioritising). In
  the larger version it has additional parameters but they are optional for
  ease of testing. Real requirements will determine how far this is from
  acceptability.
